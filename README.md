# Knowledge-intensive Processes: The Company Acquisition Process

Based on the paper ["Knowledge-Intensive Processes: Characteristics, Requirements and Analysis of Contemporary Approaches"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13740-014-0038-4), written by Di Ciccio et al., we investigated for the seminar "Pearls in BPM" (HPI summer term 2023) to which extent the modelling technqiues "flexible Case Management (fCM)" and "Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM)" are suitable for modelling the company acquisition process.
